# GestureAirDrawPro
GestureAirDrawPro is a ready-to-use Arduino library for air-drawn gesture recognition using an MPU6050 IMU on an Arduino UNO. It records orientation (pitch &amp; roll), smooths the signal, matches gestures against built-in templates (letters A–Z and digits 0–9) using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and exports it.
